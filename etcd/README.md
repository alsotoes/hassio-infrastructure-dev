etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft](https://github.com/etcd-io/raft) [README.md](https://github.com/etcd-io/raft/blob/main/README.md) consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.
